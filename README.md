# Java Core Concepts Practice

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed using **IntelliJ IDEA** to practice and implement core and intermediate Java concepts.  
The focus is on hands-on learning and understanding key programming principles.

## **📚 Overview**

This project demonstrates practical implementations of **fundamental and intermediate Java concepts**, including object-oriented programming, multithreading, design patterns, data structures, file handling, exception handling, HTTP API communication, and database connectivity using PostgreSQL. Each module is independent and designed for learning purposes.
